# MODIS Global 250m Water Map
The MODIS Global 250m Water Map layer is a complete global map of surface water coverage. The product is useful for visualizing the location of water bodies around the world.

The MODIS Global 250m Water Map (MOD44W) is a static product. It was created using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Water Body Data (SWBD), 8 years of Terra MODIS and 6 years of Aqua MODIS 250m data and the MODIS based Mosaic of Antarctica (MOA). The image resolution is 250km. It can be viewed in Worldview/GIBS. It can also be downloaded from the [Land Processes (LP) DAAC](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod44w) or the [Global Land Cover Facility - Water Mask](http://glcf.umd.edu/data/watermask/).
