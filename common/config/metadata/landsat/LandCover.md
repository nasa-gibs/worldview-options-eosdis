The 5 Year Tree Cover layer represents tree canopy cover estimated over five annual growing seasons. This layer is part of the the Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) 5-year Land Cover Land Use Change (LCLUC) product. It is a composite of 30 m land use land change product for the contiguous United States (CONUS) generated from 5 years of consecutive growing season WELD inputs from April 15, 2006, to November 17, 2010. WELD data are created using Landsat Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Terrain Corrected data.
