# OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Lower Troposphere
The OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Lower Troposphere layer indicates the column density of  sulfur dioxide in the lower troposphere (corresponding to 2.5km center of mass altitude (CMA)) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). Sulfur Dioxide and Aerosol Index products are used to monitor volcanic clouds and detect pre-eruptive volcanic degassing globally. This information is used by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers in advisories to airlines for operational decisions.

The OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Lower Troposphere layer is a science parameter of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Level 2 Total Column Sulfur Dioxide (OMSO2) dataset, available from the OMI instrument on the Aura satellite. The sensor resolution is 25km, imagery resolution is 2km, temporal resolution is daily and temporal availability for viewing in GIBS/Worldview is May 8, 2012 – present.

# OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Middle Troposphere
The OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Middle Troposphere layer indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the middle troposphere (corresponding to 7.5km center of mass altitude (CMA)) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). Sulfur Dioxide and Aerosol Index products are used to monitor volcanic clouds and detect pre-eruptive volcanic degassing globally. This information is used by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers in advisories to airlines for operational decisions.

The sensor resolution is 25km, imagery resolution is 2km, temporal resolution is daily and temporal availability for viewing in GIBS/Worldview is May 8, 2012 – present.

# OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Upper Troposphere and Stratosphere
The OMI Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) Upper Troposphere and Stratosphere layer indicates the column density of sulfur dioxide in the upper troposphere and stratosphere (corresponding to 17 km center of mass altitude (CMA)) and is measured in Dobson Units (DU). Sulfur Dioxide and Aerosol Index products are used to monitor volcanic clouds and detect pre-eruptive volcanic degassing globally. This information is used by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers in advisories to airlines for operational decisions.
