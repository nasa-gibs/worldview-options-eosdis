### OMI Aerosol Index  

This is a gridded Level-2 OMI/Aura Near-UV Aerosol Absorption and Extinction Optical Depth and Single Scattering Albedo (OMAERUV) daily composite images for the UV aerosol index (UVAI) at 354, 388 and 500 nm.

The UVAI has become an invaluable tool for tracking long-range transport of absorbing aerosols (smoke and dust) throughout the globe, even when the aerosols are over clouds. The Level 2 data is filtered for Solar Zenith Angle less than 84.0 for for the row anomaly using the row anomaly.

The map is refreshed every 100 minutes and the map is about 3 hours behind the real time.
