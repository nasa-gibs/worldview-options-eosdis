# Soil Moisture (Daily, Radiometer)
Temporal Coverage: 25 August 2011 - 7 June 2015 (Daily)

The Aquarius “Daily Soil Moisture (L3)” layer displays global soil moisture in m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>.  The Level-3 processing of Aquarius satellite data takes measurements at the boresight locations of the three Aquarius radiometer beams, which are converted into physical units of soil moisture, and maps these onto a 1 degree grid. The mean for the daily observation period is used to obtain the values for the grid.

The Aquarius instrument includes three radiometers and one scatterometer. The soil moisture data are collected by the radiometers. The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.414 GHz in the horizontal and vertical polarizations (T<sub>H</sub> and T<sub>V</sub>).

# Soil Moisture (Weekly, Radiometer)
Temporal Coverage: 25 August 2011 to 7 June 2015

The Aquarius “Weekly Soil Moisture (L3)” layer displays global soil moisture in m<sup>3</sup>/m<sup>3</sup>.  The Level-3 processing of Aquarius satellite data takes measurements at the boresight locations of the three Aquarius radiometer beams, which are converted into physical units of soil moisture, and maps these onto a 1 degree grid. The mean for the weekly observation period is used to obtain the values for the grid.

The Aquarius instrument includes three radiometers and one scatterometer. The soil moisture data are collected by the radiometers. The radiometers measure brightness temperature at 1.414 GHz in the horizontal and vertical polarizations (T<sub>H</sub> and T<sub>V</sub>).
