### Protected Areas

The Protected Areas (Polygons) layer displays global terrestrial and marine protected areas. A protected area is a geographical designated area managed for specific conservation measures. The layer is from the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) which includes national protected areas recognized by the government, areas designated under regional and international conventions, privately protected areas and indigenous people's and community conserved territories and areas.

The WDPA is provided by [Protected Planet](https://www.protectedplanet.net). It is managed by the United Nations Environment World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) with support from IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA).
