### SEDAC Population Density (GRUMP v1 2000)

The SEDAC Population Density layer indicates the  number of people per kilometer living in each grid cell in the year 2000 and is part of  the Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1) data set.

The Global Rural-Urban Mapping Project, Version 1 (GRUMPv1) consists of estimates of human population for the years 1990, 1995, and 2000 by 30 arc-second (1km) grid cells and associated data sets dated circa 2000. A proportional allocation gridding algorithm, utilizing more than 1,000,000 national and sub-national geographic units, is used to assign population values (counts, in persons) to grid cells.

The layer can be viewed in Worldview/Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) and the data can be downloaded from the [Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC)](http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/grump-v1-population-density).
