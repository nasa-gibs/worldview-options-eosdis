### AMSR2 Sea Ice Concentration, 12 km | 25 km
Temporal coverage: 2 July 2012 - present

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) "Sea Ice Concentration, 12 km | 25 km" layer displays the percent of sea ice concentration in the Polar regions at a 12.5 km and 25 km resolution.

Sea ice concentration describes the relative amount of area covered by ice, compared to some reference area and usually reported as a percentage. The relative area is a 12.5 km x 12.5 km swath or 25 km x 25 km swath.

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument is a conically scanning passive microwave radiometer sensing microwave radiation at 12 channels and 6 frequencies ranging from 6.9 to 89 GHz on board the Global Change Observation Mission â€“ Water 1 (GCOM-W1) satellite. The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 12.5 km or 25 km. The temporal resolution is daily.
