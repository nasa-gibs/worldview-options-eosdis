The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) "Sea Ice Brightness Temperature (6km, 89H)" layer displays sea ice brightness temperatures (TBs) in kelvins at the Polar regions for the 89 GHz horizontal (H) polarization. Brightness temperature data are particularly useful for sea ice studies because of the relatively high contrast in emissivities between open water and sea ice.

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument is a conically scanning passive microwave radiometer sensing microwave radiation at 12 channels and 6 frequencies ranging from 6.9 to 89 GHz on board the Global Change Observation Mission â€“ Water 1 (GCOM-W1) satellite. The imagery resolution is 2 km and sensor resolution is 6.25 km. The temporal resolution is daily.
