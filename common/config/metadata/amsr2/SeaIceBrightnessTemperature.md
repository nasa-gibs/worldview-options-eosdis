# AMSR2 Sea Ice Brightness Temperature (6km, 89H | 89V)
Temporal coverage: 13 January 2016 - present

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) "Sea Ice Brightness Temperature (6km, 89H and 89V)" layer displays sea ice brightness temperatures (TBs) in kelvins at the Polar regions for the 89 GHz horizontal (H) and vertical (V) polarizations. Brightness temperature data are particularly useful for sea ice studies because of the relatively high contrast in emissivities between open water and sea ice.

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) instrument is a conically scanning passive microwave radiometer sensing microwave radiation at 12 channels and 6 frequencies ranging from 6.9 to 89 GHz on board the Global Change Observation Mission – Water 1 (GCOM-W1) satellite.
